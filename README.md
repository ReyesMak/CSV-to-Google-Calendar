# CSV-to-Google-Calendar

Before executing the code, users need to ensure that they have installed the required libraries in the conda env:
1. openpyxl : ``` pip install openpyxl ```
2. pyexcel : ``` pip install pyexcel ```
3. datetime : ``` pip install DateTime ```
4. pandas : ``` pip install pandas ```
5. Google client : ```  pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib```
6. string : ``` pip install strings```


I strongly recommend using **Visual Studio Code** as the IDE for running the code.
Nevertheless, the code would still work with PyCharm or other IDE.
